# ATmega4809Lib
A library of classes that highlight the functionality of the ATmeg4809.

After working with the ATmega4809 off and on for a few months now I'm finding that it's pretty easy to work
with, once you learn the ins and outs and actually read the data sheet. The problem that I've been running into
is that because it is such a new chip there is very little example code or tutorials relating to it.
        
The source code I've provided relies on various external 0peripherals in order to get the code to function,
but can be modified to work with other peripherals as well.

The code provided is NOT production ready code and for that matter most of it not usuable in the form that it is in, 
the code is only an example of how the particular functionality may be performed.
